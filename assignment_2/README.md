_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

Overall the assignment took me over two weeks with the first file being started on the 11/10/20. In terms of hours spent
 on the assignment in general with seeking information approximately 50 hours with only 25 writing and fixing errors. 
 Also i did not use the WakaTime plugin because I orignally earlly which would result in the free version expiring.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com
 (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

I am most satisfied with the a1_classes file being operational as that indicated that the place and placecollection 
files also work. This also kind of gave me a bases to work of in the main.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

I am most satisfied with the main and kivy files not being. As I spent a lot of time and research on this that could be
 missing or is causing errors. However some of the kivy and main work if you comments out the lines 43 onwards.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

In my development process what worked well was the use of breaks. When I encountered a problem I would trying to solve
 it initially (fixing minior mistakes) but if don't fix the mistakes over a few attempts I take a break and
 subconsciously process it so when I come back I have most ideas to solve it.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

One major aspect that could be improved is the use of time management. Unlike most time management of starting earlier
 the issue was doing equal amount of work throughout. Eventhough I started early other assignment cause my not to work
  on the task for long periods of time, so when I came back I was behiend. Therfore I will have to mtime allocate
   assignment to different time slots in the week.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

The learning sources I used where the lecture note, records and practicals. In terms of how i used them I used the
 lecture notes to revise the topic and also used them with the recording find out spefic things. As for the practical
  I used them as exmples for concepts in the assignment.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

The main challenges I faced was the lack of notes and examples of using attributes and understanding kivy. The 
attributes issue I faced head on looking for any notes or practical examples on them. Eventhough, i got a small bit of 
information of on the topic when i used it, it wouldn't run in the test given. So i decide the save what I could in a
 commit and use lists instead. As for kivy I didn't have much time due to previous issue like the attibutes not working
  result in little time to work on the kivy and main. As a result I pieced together what I could understand and it 
  partly works.
 

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

My experience is mixed, I like the concept and when they work however they where more of a issue then help. The classes
 did help in reducing the amount of code written however due to attributes not working I would of prefered all of the 
 code to be in one file.
